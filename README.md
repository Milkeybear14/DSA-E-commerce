# DSA E-COMMERCE PROJECT :octocat:

### OVERVIEW
```
For this project we used C++ as a main programming language and 
SQLITE3 as a main database.
```
### DESIGN CHOICES
```
We make this project to work on compiler or compiler application. To
make it work in time.
```
### DATA STRUCTURES USED
```
We used STACK data structure to save the products to the database
and QUEUE data structure to save the ordering details to the database.
```
### HOW TO RUN 
```
To run our project in your pc you we provided 2 ways if you want to see 
how it works everything you can compile the source code or the file 
named main.cpp by writing this in the terminal g++ main.cpp –o main –l 
sqlite3 and the to run the compiled file will be in the same directory as 
the main.cpp so write main in the terminal and hit enter.
The other way is there is the already compiled executable files called 
main.exe so by you can start it by double click it.
```
> **ATTENTITON** : To run the application don’t delete the main.db in the root directory or the main.exe and main.db must’ve to be in the same directory in the same directory.
